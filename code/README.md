# Using the drone

### Step 1: Compile and inject the code
This folder can be opened with platformIO for automatic configuration. 

You can also just use the arduino IDE after importing the right libraries and board configs.

### Step 2: Play around with the code and fly
The sample program provided will just try to maintain the drone's current attitude and altitude. Enjoy :)
